# AI Assistance

## Overview

DocuForge AI provides powerful AI capabilities to assist with documentation creation, improvement, and code generation. This guide covers how to effectively use AI assistance features throughout the platform.

## Documentation Assistance

### Writing Suggestions

As you write documentation, the AI assistant can provide real-time suggestions:

1. Start writing in the document editor
2. AI will highlight opportunities for improvement
3. Hover over highlighted text to see suggestions
4. Accept or dismiss suggestions with a single click

### Document Quality Enhancement

Improve existing documentation with AI analysis:

1. Select text or an entire document
2. Click the "Enhance" button in the toolbar
3. Choose enhancement types:
   - Clarity improvements
   - Completeness check
   - Consistency verification
   - Technical accuracy review
   - Style conformance
4. Review and apply suggested changes

### Content Generation

Generate new documentation sections quickly:

1. Click the "Generate" button in the editor toolbar
2. Provide a brief description of what to generate
3. Optionally specify the tone and technical level
4. Review, edit, and incorporate the generated content

## Code Generation

### Generate Implementation from Documentation

Create code directly from your documentation specifications:

1. Navigate to a document containing specifications
2. Click the "Generate Code" button
3. Select the target language and framework
4. Review the generated code
5. Export to a code file or copy to clipboard

### Generate Tests from Documentation

Automatically create tests based on documented requirements:

1. Navigate to a document with requirements
2. Click the "Generate Tests" button
3. Select the testing framework
4. Review and export the generated tests

## LLMs.txt Optimization

Use AI to optimize your LLMs.txt exports:

1. In the LLMs.txt Generator, click "AI Optimize"
2. The AI will analyze your documentation and suggest:
   - Optimal organization of sections
   - Improved descriptions for documentation links
   - Better summaries for the project
3. Review and apply the suggestions

## AI Settings and Customization

### Model Selection

Choose the AI model that best fits your needs:

1. Navigate to Settings > AI Configuration
2. Select from available models:
   - Standard: Balanced performance and cost
   - Professional: Enhanced capabilities for technical documentation
   - Enterprise: Customized to your organization's needs

### Domain Adaptation

Train the AI on your specific technical domain:

1. Navigate to Settings > AI Configuration > Domain Adaptation
2. Upload example documentation from your domain
3. Configure adaptation settings
4. Start the adaptation process
5. Use the adapted model for more relevant assistance

### Style Guides

Connect your organization's style guides to the AI:

1. Navigate to Settings > Style Guides
2. Upload or create style guide documentation
3. Enable AI enforcement of style guidelines
4. Set strictness level for style suggestions

## Best Practices

### Effective Prompting

When requesting AI generation, provide clear context:

- Specify the audience and technical level
- Include relevant technical details
- Describe the tone and style you want
- Reference existing documentation for consistency

### Review and Refinement

- Always review AI-generated content for accuracy
- Refine generated content to match your voice and style
- Use AI as a starting point, not the final product
- Iterate with the AI to improve results

### Feedback Loop

Improve AI assistance over time:

1. Provide feedback on AI suggestions and generations
2. Rate the quality and relevance of AI output
3. Document specific strengths and weaknesses
4. Use the feedback to improve future AI interactions

## Privacy and Data Usage

- AI processing happens in a secure environment
- Your documentation is not used to train general models
- Domain adaptation uses only your uploaded examples
- Sensitive information can be masked from AI processing
