- Secure handling of AI-generated content
- Careful handling of sensitive information in LLMs.txt exports

### DevEx
- Local development environment with containerization
- Extensive documentation (eating our own dog food)
- Plugin architecture for extensibility
- CLI tools for managing LLMs.txt generation

### Adoption Strategy
- Initial focus on solo developers and small teams
- Documentation templates for common project types
- Integration with existing tools (GitHub, Linear, etc.)
- Showcase examples of effective LLMs.txt implementations

### Roadmap Phases
1. **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Core editor with Git integration, basic organization, and LLMs.txt export
2. **Phase 2**: AI assistance and metadata tagging system
3. **Phase 3**: Visual canvas organization and advanced AI features
4. **Phase 4**: Code generation from documentation

This specification outlines a powerful platform that transforms documentation from a post-development burden into the central driving force of product development, particularly for individual developers and small teams leveraging AI assistance. The addition of LLMs.txt export capability will ensure that documentation created in DocuForge AI is not only human-friendly but also optimized for consumption by AI assistants, creating a virtuous cycle where AI can better assist with both documentation and implementation.
